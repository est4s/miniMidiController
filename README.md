Mini Midi Controller is a plug and play midi controller I designed to use with my guitar for live looping. Each button corresponds to one midi note that can be assign to any function in DAW softwares. 

It consists of 3 buttons and an Arduino Pro Micro. 

I'm planning to add one more button for program change function and an RGB led for program indication.
